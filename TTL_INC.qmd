# Introduction to Logic

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the lesson, the students are expected to:

1. Define and illustrate a **proposition**  
2. Distinguish between **simple** and **compound** propositions  
3. Demonstrate understanding of propositions through **real-life applications**

---

## Content Standards

The learner demonstrates understanding of key concepts in **propositional logic**, **syllogisms**, and **fallacies**.

## Performance Standards

The learner is able to **apply logic judiciously** in real-life arguments.

## Learning Competencies

- Illustrates and symbolizes propositions.  
- Distinguishes between simple and compound propositions. (M11GM-IIg-3)  
- Performs different types of operations on propositions. (M11GM-IIg-4)

# Review Activity

### Activity: *Is it True?*

Tell whether each item is **true**, **false**, or **cannot be determined**.

1. Manila is the capital of the Philippines.  
2. What is your favorite color?  
3. 4 + 2 = 7  
4. Who invented the microscope?  
5. The Earth is round.

**Guide Answer:**  
1 – True  
2 – Cannot be determined  
3 – False  
4 – Cannot be determined  
5 – True

# What is a Proposition?

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is **either true or false**, but not both.  
If the proposition is true, its truth value is **T**.  
If the proposition is false, its truth value is **F**.

Propositions are usually denoted by **small letters** such as *p*, *q*, *r*, etc.

Example:

- **p:** “Everyone should study logic.”

We may write it symbolically as:

> p is the proposition “Everyone should study logic.”

# Types of Propositions

## Simple Proposition

A **simple proposition** cannot be broken down into smaller propositions.

**Examples:**

1. Letter E is a vowel.  
2. 2x + 5x = 7x  
3. Bagabag is in Nueva Vizcaya.

---

## Compound Proposition

A **compound proposition** is formed by connecting two or more simple propositions using logical connectors.

### Logical Connectors

- **~** : negation (not)  
- **∨** : or  
- **∧** : and  
- **→** : if… then  
- **↔** : if and only if  

---

# Examples on Logical Connectors

Let:

- **p:** Even numbers are divisible by 2  
- **q:** Five is an odd number  

Then:

- **~p** : Even numbers are **not** divisible by 2  
- **p ∨ q** : Even numbers are divisible by 2 **or** five is an odd number  
- **p ∧ q** : Even numbers are divisible by 2 **and** five is an odd number  
- **p → q** : If even numbers are divisible by 2, then five is an odd number  
- **p ↔ q** : Even numbers are divisible by 2 *if and only if* five is an odd number

---

### Another Example

Let:

- **p:** The Earth is round  
- **q:** The Moon orbits the Earth  

Then:

- **~p** : The Earth is not round  
- **p ∨ q** : The Earth is round or the Moon orbits the Earth  
- **p ∧ q** : The Earth is round and the Moon orbits the Earth  
- **p → q** : If the Earth is round, then the Moon orbits the Earth  
- **p ↔ q** : The Earth is round if and only if the Moon orbits the Earth

# Activity 1: Logical Connectors

Given:

- **p:** Andrei is watching  
- **q:** Justine shares a bond with Jane  

Write the compound propositions:

a. ~p  
b. p ∨ q  
c. p ∧ q  
d. p → q  
e. p ↔ q  

**Answer Key:**

a. Andrei is not watching.  
b. Andrei is watching or Justine shares a bond with Jane.  
c. Andrei is watching and Justine shares a bond with Jane.  
d. If Andrei is watching, then Justine shares a bond with Jane.  
e. Andrei is watching if and only if Justine shares a bond with Jane.

# Real-Life Application

### Reflection Question

**How can you apply the concept of propositions in real-life situations?**

(Answers may vary.)

---

# Generalization

1. What is a proposition?  
2. What are the two types of propositions?  
3. Give an example of each type.

---

# Evaluation

### Part I. Identify if the statement is a proposition. If it is, give the truth value.

1. Mindanao is an island in the Philippines.  
2. Find a number that divides your age.  
3. My seatmate will get a perfect score in the Logic exam.  
4. Welcome to the Philippines!  

### Part II. Symbolic Form

Let:

- **p:** You drive over 65 miles per hour.  
- **q:** You get a speeding ticket.  

Write the symbolic form:

a. You do not drive over 65 miles per hour.  
b. You will get a speeding ticket if you drive over 65 miles per hour.  
c. If you do not drive over 65 miles per hour, then you will not get a speeding ticket.

**Answer Key:**

1.  
- p: Proposition – True  
- q: Not a proposition (directive)  
- r: Proposition – truth depends on outcome  
- s: Not a proposition (greeting)

2.  
a. ¬p  
b. p → q  
c. ¬p → ¬q
